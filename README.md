# Daily-Pill-Dispenser-Reminder-Reminder-Project
Includes design document to instruct on how to recreate, STL files of the pill dispenser to 3d print, breadboard skematic of the circuit in fritzing, and the program in Arduio IDE.

Programmed in UNO IDE
This code is for running my Pill dispenser and reminder project.
It involves a LCD, RTC, Buzzer, 3 buttons, and a stepper motor component. 
Copy it over to Arduino IDE and download these libraries:
liquid crystal, RTClib, RTCZero, AdaFruit BUSIO

I have created design document for further instructions for recreation.
