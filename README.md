# Daily-Pill-Dispenser-Reminder-Reminder-Project
Includes STL files of the pill dispenser model for use in recreation


Programmed in UNO IDE
This code is for running my Pill dispenser and reminder project.
It involves a LCD, RTC, Buzzer, 3 buttons, and a stepper motor component. 
Copy it over to Arduino IDE and download these libraries:
liquid crystal, RTClib, RTCZero, AdaFruit BUSIO

I have created design doccument for further instructions for recreation.
