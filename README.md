# Pill-Dispenser-Reminder-Code
Programmed in UNO IDE
This code is for running my Pill dispenser and reminder project.
It involves a LCD, RTC, Buzzer, 3 buttons, and a stepper motor component. 
Copy it over to Arduino IDE and download these libraries:
liquid crystal, RTClib, RTCZero, AdaFruit BUSIO

I have a design doccument for further instructions for recreation.
